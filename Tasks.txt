Coding standards are a set of guidelines, rules, and best practices that are established to ensure the consistency, readability, maintainability, and quality of software code. Following coding standards is essential in software engineering because it makes code easier to understand, reduces the chance of errors and bugs, and helps with collaboration among team members.

Here are some common coding standards in software engineering:

Naming Conventions: 
		Consistent naming conventions should be used for variables, functions, and classes. 
		This makes code easier to read and understand.

Indentation and Formatting: 
		Consistent indentation and formatting make code easier to read and understand.
		Different companies and organizations may have their own preferences, but the most important thing is that it is consistent.

Commenting:
	    Comments should be used to explain the code, particularly if it is complex or if it is not immediately clear what it does. 
          Comments should be concise, clear, and easy to read.

Error Handling: 
  		Code should handle errors gracefully and consistently, with clear error messages that help users or developers understand what went wrong.

Function Size:
		Functions should be small and do only one thing.
		This makes the code easier to understand and maintain.

Code Reuse:
	    Code should be designed to be reusable, meaning that it can be used in multiple parts of the system without modification. 
	    This reduces duplication and makes the code more efficient.


Testing:
	  Code should be tested thoroughly to ensure that it works as expected and that it doesn't introduce any new bugs or errors.

Overall, following coding standards helps ensure that software code is high quality, maintainable, and efficient.

Algorithm to find the second largest number of sequence

1.start
2.Initialize two variables, largest and second_largest, to be the smallest possible value that the data type can hold.
3.Traverse through the sequence of numbers and compare each number to the current largest value.
4.If the current number is greater than the largest, then update second_largest to be largest and update largest to be the current number.
5.If the current number is less than or equal to largest but greater than second_largest, then update second_largest to be the current number.
6.Once the traversal is complete, the second_largest variable should contain the second largest number in the sequence.
7.end
